> ## Conflict Plan

- Vote, or call in Audrey if needed, to resolve any conflicts that arise.
- Third-party or outside opinion to help resolve conflicts.
- TEAM R-A-D comes first!

- Stand-ups can be used to touch base, communicate, and address concerns.

- Communicate if we're having problems, and if we have concerns.

- As much as possible, reach out to Audrey as a team, rather than individually -- communicate first!
